Model representation format

ACCORDION uses the element-based BioRECIPES representation format described in [1], which includes for each model element: 
(i) name, 
(ii) type (protein, gene, RNA, or a chemical), 
(iii) identifier from a database (e.g., UniProt [2]), 
(iv) variable that represents state, and 
(v) set of regulators written using a notation that captures different discrete functions (e.g., weighted sum, min/max, Boolean). 
All benchmark presented in this work are written in the BioRECIPES representation format. 
From this format, executable models are generated automatically as part of the DiSH simulator [3], which is publicly available.
